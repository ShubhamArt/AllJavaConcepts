Factory Pattern:
Used to create one type of product or related products based on certain parameters or
conditions. It defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

Abstract Factory Pattern:
Used to create families of related or dependent objects. It provides an
interface to create related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
