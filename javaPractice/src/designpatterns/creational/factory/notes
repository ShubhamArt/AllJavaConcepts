Use the Factory to Get the Object in Client Code
The Factory Pattern is widely used in frameworks like Javaâ€™s Collection Framework (List, Set, etc.),
where factory methods like List.of() or Set.of() return appropriate concrete implementations based on input.

Spring uses the Factory pattern to create beans through @Bean methods in configuration classes or with @Component,
 @Service, etc., annotations.
Example: The BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring are examples of factory pattern implementations
 that create and manage beans.

advantages
1) focus on creating object for interface rather than implementation
2) loose coupling more robust code
