//Singleton Pattern: The getInstance() method implements double-checked locking to ensure that Animal is
// instantiated only once in a thread-safe manner.
//Private Constructor: The private constructor prevents instantiation from outside, enforcing a single instance.
//Default Properties: The species and name properties have default values, but they can be
// changed using setter methods.
