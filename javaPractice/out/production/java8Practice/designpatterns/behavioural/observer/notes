Explanation of the Code:

The StockPrice class is the subject. It maintains the state of the stock price and notifies its observers whenever the price changes.
The User class is an observer. Each user subscribes to receive notifications about changes in the stock price.
When the stock price changes (via setPrice()), the notifyObservers() method is called, which triggers the update() method in each observer.

Benefits of the Observer Pattern:

Decoupling: The subject (StockPrice) does not need to know the specific details about its observers (users). It just knows that it needs to notify them when a change occurs.
Flexibility: You can easily add or remove observers without modifying the subject.
Real-time Updates: This pattern is ideal for real-time notification systems where users or components need to be updated as soon as data changes.

Use Cases:

Stock price updates (as shown in the example).
Event-driven systems where UI components need to be updated when backend data changes (e.g., chat applications, real-time dashboards).
Notifications in applications (e.g., email or push notifications when a userâ€™s profile is updated).

Considerations:

If the number of observers grows very large, the performance might degrade, especially if notifications are frequent.
If observers perform expensive operations upon receiving updates, it could impact system performance, so asynchronous handling might be necessary in such cases.
