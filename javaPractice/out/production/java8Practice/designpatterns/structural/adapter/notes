AndroidCharger Class:

The Android charger has a chargeWithUSB() method which is incompatible with the Apple phoneâ€™s expected charging interface.

Inside chargeWithLightning(), it adapts by calling chargeWithUSB() on the AndroidCharger instance, allowing an Apple phone to charge with an Android charger through the adapter.
